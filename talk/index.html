    <blockquote cite="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">
		<p>Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, 
        we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, 
        and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. 
        And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development 
        team, so our costs would be lower.... Somewhat surprisingly, it worked.</p>

        <p>in Haskell there is a significantly lower emphasis on unit testing and a 
    greater emphasis on using the type system and equational reasoning to prove 
    your program is correct. Unit tests are a good starting point until you can

    <h2>But there's one small problem with locks</h2>
    <h3>Well, actually, there are about five big problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Taking too few locks.</strong> You forget to take a lock and two threads end up overwriting data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Taking too many locks.</strong> Your system slows to a crawl, a situation known as thread starvation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Taking the wrong locks.</strong> You lock 
            out an unrelated thread while your thread blithely creates a race condition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Taking locks in the wrong order.</strong> Suddenly you have 
            what's known as the Dining Philosophers problem. Two locks just sit there and say "After you... No, after you...
            I insist, after you..."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Backing out of the inevitable errors.</strong> It's 
            difficult to guarantee that concurrent transactions are truly atomic. Very easy to leave a system
            in an inconsistent state.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="concurrency-4">
    <h2>But the Worst Thing About Locks</h2>
    <h3>The Worst thing about lock-based concurrency is that the locks themselves 
    are not <span style="font-style:italic">composable</span>.</h3>
    <p>In our bank account example, I cannot compose a transfer operation out of individual
    thread-safe withdraw and deposit operations. If I need to disburse money to a hundred accounts, I need
    locks on every account. The intermediate state, where I've pulled money from account #1 but not yet deposited it
    in accounts #2 through #101 is practically impossible to hide from external threads.</p>
    <h3>It is impossible, given the current state of the art in Java, to compose an entire thread-safe system 
    out of smaller thread-safe components. Lock contention, deadlocks, and race conditions are always a risk.</h3>
    <p class="slide">Java's concurrency implementation is today's version of GOTO BASIC and spaghetti code.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="concurrency-5">
    <h2>Imagine your Ideal Concurrent System</h2>
    <h3>What would concurrency done right look like?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="slide">
            <p>Concurrent operations would be an all-or-nothing affair. Data would never be left in an inconsistent state</p>
        </li>
        <li class="slide">
            <p>Data would never be left in an inconsistent state</p>
        </li>
        <li class="slide">
            <p>Race conditions are disallowed. Operations by separate threads look like
            they happened within the same thread. (Easier to reason about your system this way.)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="slide">
            <p>It is durable, prone to recovery after errors.</span></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="slide">In other words, what we want from our system are the same guarantees that 
    databases have been giving us for decades. The above just described your standard ACID transaction.
    (Ideally, though, I'd prefer to live without the overhead of managing a transaction log.)</h3>

<section class="slide" id="concurrency-5">
    <h2>Java Transactions</h2>
    <h3>Of course, Java does have transactions, but the Java Transaction API 
    relies entirely on external systems -- usually a database -- to manage the transaction for it. </h3>
    <p>I'm looking for the same level of transactional control within the language's runtime itself,
    and here's where Java falls down.</p>

<section class="slide" id="STM-1">
    <h2>Software Transactional Memory</h2>
    <h3>Here's a simplified version of what our bank transaction might look like in Haskell:</h3>
    <pre><code>import Control.Monad
import Control.Concurrent.STM

type Account = TVar Int

credit :: Int -> Account -> STM ()
credit amount account = do
    current <- readTVar account
    writeTVar account (current + amount)

debit :: Int -> Account -> STM ()
debit amount account = do
    current <- readTVar account
    writeTVar account (current - amount)

transfer :: Int -> Account -> Account -> STM ()
transfer amount from to = do
    fromVal <- readTVar from
    if (fromVal - amount) >= 0
       then do
             debit amount from
             credit amount to
       else retry  -- in real life, we'd wrap a 
                   -- timeout around this</code></pre>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="STM-2">
    <h2>Software Transactional Memory</h2>
    <h3>Now, to run the code, all we have to do is add some helpers and a main function:</h3>
    <pre><code>
    
    newAccount :: Int -> STM Account
    newAccount balance = newTVar balance

    transferTest :: STM (Int, Int)
    transferTest = do
        ac1 <- newAccount 20
        ac2 <- newAccount 30
        transfer 5 ac1 ac2
        liftM2 (,) (readTVar ac1) (readTVar ac2)
    
    main :: IO ()
    main = do
        (amt1, amt2) <- atomically transferTest
        putStrLn $ (show amt1) ++ ", " ++ (show amt2)</code></pre>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="STM-3">
    <h2>Software Transactional Memory</h2>
    <h3>Some things to note about what we just did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="slide">We just implemented a threadsafe function without locks, and without relying on an external system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide">This code isn't perfect. (Ideally we'd want timeouts and exceptions, which are available in Haskell.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="slide">But it is a lot cleaner than the Java alternative.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Software Transactional Memory</h2>
    <h3>The combination of default immutability, strong types-within-types, and first-class functions give us 
      a very strong foundation for building fully transactional concurrency within the language itself.</h3>
